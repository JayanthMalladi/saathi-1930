// A simulated Saathi ↔ Rohit alert call, modelled on a real Bolna call (fake customer care, AnyDesk):
// bank-flagged debit, safety step, consent, other debit with UTR, scammer phone, then next steps. All numbers use 9999-prefixed fake UTRs.
//
// One clock drives the whole page: the in-call timer, waveform, transcript highlight and the receipt all read
// the current time and look up the beat whose `t` (seconds from call start) has most recently passed.
//
// The audio at site/public/call.mp3 is a reenactment, not a live call: Saathi's lines exactly as the agent says them,
// voiced with her Bolna voice (Sarvam bulbul:v3 "Priya") through Sarvam's TTS API, and the caller voiced by Sarvam "Rahul".
// The `t` values below are where each line starts in that file.
//
// Swapping in a different recording:
//   1. Put the Bolna recording at site/public/call.mp3 (it is not in the repo; vite.config.ts checks for it at
//      dev/build start, so restart `npm run dev` / re-run `npm run build` after adding it).
//   2. Replace each beat's `t` below with the second that line starts in the recording, and set CALL_TOTAL to
//      the recording's length (the engine also reads the real duration from the file once it loads).
//   3. If the recording's wording differs, update `text` so the transcript matches what is heard.
// Without the file the engine runs the same timeline on a simulated clock.
